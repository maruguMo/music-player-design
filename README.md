# Music Player Design
This was a daily UI design challenge. A music player can be done in so many ways. This is just my idea of it. It utlizes fontawesome and bootstrap
## Maybe I will add code to play some music
But this should be straight foward using javascript built functions. The only thing is to add visualizations
